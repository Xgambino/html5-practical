# Nyumbani Real Estate — HTML5 Practical (No JS, No Forms)

This project demonstrates modern HTML5 semantics, accessibility, and media embedding using a real estate theme.  
It is built as part of an HTML5 practical exercise and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Pages Overview

- **index.html** — Home page with semantic structure, skip link, headings, time, mark, abbr, code, kbd, samp, blockquote, and internal anchors.  
- **about.html** — Company history, services, and glossary. Demonstrates `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>`.  
- **media.html** — Responsive `<picture>` images, `<figure>` + `<figcaption>`, audio, and video with `.vtt` captions.  
- **extras.html** — Tables with caption/thead/tbody/tfoot, `<details>`, `<dialog open>`, `<progress>`, and `<meter>`.

## Learning Goals

- Semantic HTML5 layout using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.  
- Accessibility features: skip links, alt text, proper headings, and ARIA-friendly nav.  
- Media embedding: audio, video (with captions), and responsive images.  
- Micro-elements: `<time>`, `<mark>`, `<abbr>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`, `<blockquote>`, `<address>`.  
- Non-JS interactivity: `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<dialog open>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>`.  
- Valid, clean HTML5 (passes W3C Validator).
