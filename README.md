# Nyumbani Real Estate — HTML5 Practical (No JS, No Forms)

This project demonstrates modern HTML5 semantics, accessibility, media embedding, and advanced CSS styling using a real estate theme.  
It is built as part of an HTML5 practical exercise and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Pages Overview

- **index.html** — Home page with semantic structure, skip link, headings, time, mark, abbr, code, kbd, samp, blockquote, and internal anchors.  
- **about.html** — Company history, services, and glossary. Demonstrates `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>`.  
- **media.html** — Responsive `<picture>` images, `<figure>` + `<figcaption>`, audio, and video with `.vtt` captions.  
- **extras.html** — Tables with caption/thead/tbody/tfoot, `<details>`, `<dialog open>` (in-flow), `<progress>`, and `<meter>`. Dialog box now appears in flow below notices instead of floating.

## CSS Highlights

- **Luxury modern design** with glassmorphism: semi-transparent backgrounds, blur effects, and subtle shadows.  
- **Typography**: Inter for clean body/headings, Fira Code for inline code samples.  
- **Hover & focus effects**: smooth transitions, link underlines, lift effects on articles and media.  
- **Tables**: clean, normal styling with zebra striping, fully readable without being overly styled.  
- **Dialog boxes**: in-flow, responsive, non-floating, styled with border-radius, shadow, and padding.  
- **Progress & Meter bars**: gradient fills, rounded corners, fully styled without JS.  
- **Media elements**: responsive, with hover zoom and soft shadows.

## Learning Goals

- Semantic HTML5 layout using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.  
- Accessibility features: skip links, alt text, proper headings, and ARIA-friendly nav.  
- Media embedding: audio, video (with captions), and responsive images.  
- Micro-elements: `<time>`, `<mark>`, `<abbr>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`, `<blockquote>`, `<address>`.  
- Non-JS interactivity: `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<dialog open>` (now in-flow), `<progress>`, `<meter>`.  
- Advanced CSS: glassmorphism, hover lifts, transitions, responsive media, and modern tables.  
- Valid, clean HTML5 (passes W3C Validator).
